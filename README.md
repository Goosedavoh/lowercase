# lowercase
a terminal that trumps all other terminals. We prioritize efficiency and customization.
The terminal works right off download. You can customize it by adding your commands, and modes.
We do include a copy of CMD and Powershell. 
The best part is that you can write your commands in ANY language. 
(note so far LowerCase is only available for Windows. However, later in the future, we plan to port it to Linux.)
